# Marchine learning learning notes, labs, tutorials

Everything listed here are learned outside of school.
In school, linear algebra, statistics and statistical machine learning
(linear regression, SVM, etc) courses are foundations.

## Completed

- [Machine Learning Foundations](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/ml20fall/) @ NTU
 - Theories and foundations. Not focused deep learning.
 - Notes at [WordPress Site](https://levendlee.com/category/machine-learning/machine-learning-foundations/).

- [Introduction To Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F23/index.html) @ CMU
 - Introduction to deep learning. Focused on supervised learning.
